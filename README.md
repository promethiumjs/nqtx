# NQTX
*The official state management solution for [nqtui](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui)*

Nqtx is a powerful state management library that extends the default state manangement available in 
[nqtui](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui) in order to make mananging state very simple and empowering.
It is greatly inspired by [recoil](https://recoiljs.org/), [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), [redux](https://redux.js.org/),
while also trying to be different in its own ways that make it more of a fit for [nqtui](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui).
