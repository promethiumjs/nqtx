# NQTX

*The official state management solution for [nqtui](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui)*

Nqtx is a powerful state management library that extends the default state manangement available in
[nqtui](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui) in order to make mananging state very simple and empowering.
It is greatly inspired by [recoil](https://recoiljs.org/), [pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/), [redux](https://redux.js.org/),
while also trying to be different in its own ways that make it more of a fit for [nqtui](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtui).

Nqtx is however undergoing a substantial API redesign and is not recommended for use in projects. The redesign shouldn't take
long it is relatively active development. For the meantime, feel free to take a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/promethiumjs/nqtx/wiki)
which is also currently being worked on, or skim through the codebase if that interests you.
